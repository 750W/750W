## Plunging into Python

Ishaan, our Vice-Captain, spearheaded an initiative to introduce younger children (9 - 14) to programming through Python. They would be familiarized to the basics of computer science, which are essential for robotics, which is in the interests of the club, and we wanted to have an impact on our community.

Our pilot class had 13 members, which we were really excited about, and they learned the basics of control flow, variables, loops, modules (particularity `random`).
